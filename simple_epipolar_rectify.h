    // We want H*e ~ (1, 0, 0). So let's build a matrix that takes (ex, ey, ez) -> (1,0,?).

    //   H =  [  1  0  0 ]
    //         [  0  1  0 ]
    //         [ -1/ex  -0  1 ]
    // could do it. But let's do something more stable from the typical formula:

    // A common formula (Hartley 1997/ HZ textbook) for H2:
    //   H2 = T * G, where T is translation to shift image center, G is a transformation sending e->infinity.
    // Let's do a simpler direct approach:

    // We'll define a projective transform s.t. the new X' = X / (aX + bY + c).
    // We'll pick a, b, c so that e gets mapped to infinity. Typically a= e_x, b=e_y, c=e_z.

    // => Another standard approach is:
    //    H = I - (2 / (ex^2+ey^2)) * [e]*∞ + ...
    // (But let's keep it simpler.)

    // We'll do: H2 = A * (translation that moves image center)...

    // For demonstration, let's pick the approach from "HZ 11.13" (Rectification with epipoles).
    // That formula is somewhat lengthy, so let's do a more direct code. 
    // Here is a simpler piece:

    // Suppose we want e -> (1,0,0). That means for any point X, X' = H*X (up to scale).
    // Let e' = H*e. We require e'(0)=1, e'(1)=0, e'(2)=0. That is 3 conditions => enough to define 9 dof of H minus scale.

    // We can solve it with a small system. But let's do a direct approach:

    // We'll define H as:
    //   H = [ 1  0   tx ]
    //       [ 0  1   ty ]
    //       [ a  b   c  ]
    // and solve for (tx,ty,a,b,c) so that H e = (1, 0, 0).
    // If we let e=(ex,ey,ez), then
    //   H e = (ex + tx*ez,  ey + ty*ez,  a*ex + b*ey + c*ez).
    // We want => (ex + tx*ez,  ey + ty*ez) = (k, 0) for some k, and (a*ex + b*ey + c*ez)=0.
    // Then we want the final to be (1,0,0) up to a scale factor k. So let's pick k=1 => ex + tx*ez=1 => tx = (1 - ex)/ez, and ey + ty*ez=0 => ty=-ey/ez
    // and a*ex + b*ey + c*ez=0 => we can pick (a,b,c) = (0,0,1) for instance => that yields 0 => we need 0? Actually that yields c*ez => must be 0 => so c=0? 
    // Let's do c=0 => a=0 => b=0 => => that doesn't solve. 
    // Another approach: let's pick a=0, b=0 => then c*ez=0 => c=0 => that won't transform. 
    // We see we need at least something in the third row to create the "projective push". 
    // Usually a standard trick is set a=ex, b=ey, c=ez => so the third row is e^T. Then e is mapped to (ex,ey,ez)*e = e^2 but that doesn't necessarily yield (1,0,0)...

    // It's easiest to rely on the standard formula from HZ eqn. (9.15) or so. Because "hand-solved" can be error-prone.

    // Let's do a simpler short approach: for the right image we can do:
    //   H2 = A * M, where M moves the principal point to origin, A is a 2D transform that sets e2 to (∞).
    //   see: https://visl.technion.ac.il/wiki/index.php/Epipolar_Geometry#Rectification

    // For brevity, let's do a minimal approach: if e is not at infinity (ez != 0), we can do:
    cv::Mat H_ = (cv::Mat_<double>(3,3) << 
          1, 0, -ex/ez, 
          0, 1, -ey/ez,
          0, 0,   1     );
    // This moves the epipole to x-axis near infinity. Not fully rigorous, but enough to show the idea.

    // Multiply identity by that shift:
    H = H_ * H;
    return H;

 * @brief A simpler demonstration of uncalibrated stereo rectification using epipoles.

 *
 * The idea:

    // 2) Create a homography H2 that sends e2 to "horizontal infinity"
    H2 = makeH(e2, imageSize.width, imageSize.height);

    // 3) We also want a homography H1 for the left image so that each pair of epipolar lines end up on the
    //    same horizontal lines. A typical formula from Hartley & Zisserman is:
    //       H1 = inv(M),   H2 = ...
    //    or from other references:
    //       H1 ~ (some transform that ensures lines in left map to lines in right).
    //
    // For demonstration, let's do something minimal: 
    // we want that for each point x in left image, the epipolar line l2 in the right image after H2 has the same y.
    // Typically, we can do:
    //        H1 = K * R * K^-1   in the calibrated case.
    // But uncalibrated we must do a projective transform that forces matching. 
    //
    // There's a well-known short formula for uncalibrated rectification:
    //   H1 = G + e2 * l'^T
    //   H2 = ...
    // However, implementing it fully is a bit lengthy. 
    // For simplicity, let's do the same approach as for H2: just push e1 to infinity with a "makeH(e1,...)".
    // This doesn't guarantee that corresponding lines have exactly the same y, but it does make epipolar lines horizontal in both images.
    // That alone is often enough for a naive stereo alignment. 
    // If you truly want the same horizontal lines, you'll need the more advanced formula from the literature.

    H1 = makeH(e1, imageSize.width, imageSize.height);
    // The result is that both images have horizontally oriented epipolar lines. 
    // However, you may find that the lines do not line up exactly row-for-row. 
    // For real usage, see "stereoRectifyUncalibrated" or the references in HZ.

    // We'll be done: the user can warp with H1, H2.
